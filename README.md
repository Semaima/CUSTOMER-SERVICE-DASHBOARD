# CUSTOMER-SERVICE-REPORT-DASHBOARD

## My First Data Analyst Dashboard

This dashboard holds a special place in my journey as a data analyst, representing the beginning of my exploration into the world of data. I have chosen not to edit it, as it contains a wealth of memories and marks the initial steps in my data analysis career.

## Dataset Overview:

In this dataset, there are 100 rows of customer service data specific to a Nigerian online streaming service company. Key columns include Ticket ID, Customer Name, Issue, Priority, Status, Assigned To, Opened Date, Closed Date, and Customer Rating. The Customer Rating column reflects the rating given by each customer, ranging from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating.

## Tasks Accomplished:

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Removed redundancy and duplicates to ensure data accuracy.

- **Excel Functions - IFS:**
  - Utilized the "IFS" Excel function to gain better insights into the dataset.

- **Pivot Table Creation:**
  - Created a pivot table for aggregating and summarizing relevant information.

- **First Dashboard Creation:**
  - Crafted my first data analyst dashboard using Microsoft Excel, symbolizing the beginning of my journey in this field. ðŸ˜Š

## Reflection:

As I reflect on this project, I am reminded of the learning process and the excitement of creating my first dashboard. The utilization of Excel functions and the creation of a simple dashboard were pivotal in my early understanding of data analysis.
